PyBank

In this Challenge, I created a Python script to analyze the financial records of my company's database budget_data.csv. This dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

My Python script analyzed the records and calculated each of the following values:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period




PyPoll 

In this Challenge, I helped a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

The election_data.csv dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". I created a Python script that analyzed the votes and calculates each of the following values:

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote

I levarage the Xpert Learning Assistant to understand some errors and took an idea regarding how to fix them.
I also consulted my tutors during tutorial and office hours to help with some of my election result analysis.
